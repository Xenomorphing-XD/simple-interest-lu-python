# simple-interest

here's an example Python program that calculates the simple interest based on the given formula:
Simple Interest = (P x T x R)/100 
Where, P is the principal amount 
T is the time  
R is the rate.


In this program, we first get the input from the user for the principal amount, time in years, and rate of interest. We convert the input values to float using the float() function since the input function returns a string value.

We then use the given formula to calculate the simple interest and store it in the simple_interest variable. Finally, we output the result using the print() function.

Note that we've used the comma operator to separate the string and variable in the print statement. This will output the string and the value of the simple_interest variable separated by a space.
